PIK3CA	R88Q	ACTIVATING	A recurrent mutational hot spot in endometrial carcinoma that increases PI3K activity that is considered a gain-of-function alteration (Rudd et. al., 2011; Oda et. al., 2008). R88 lies within a highly conserved surface of the PI3K adaptor binding domain and forms a hydrogen bond with D746 in the kinase domain. Alterations at this codon result in disruption of protein conformation and increased kinase activity (Rudd et. al., 2011; Huang et. al., 2007).			21266528, 18829572, 18079394		MUTATION
PIK3CA	R108H	ACTIVATING	A recurrently mutated residue in endometrial carcinoma that increases PI3K activity and is considered a gain-of-function alteration (Rudd et. al., 2011; Oda et. al., 2008).			21266528, 18829572		MUTATION
PIK3CA	G118D	ACTIVATING	A germline mutation found in patients with Cowden syndrome that lack a PTEN germline mutation.  This mutation results in increased p110? protein levels and elevated phospho-Thr308-AKT1 levels		Cowden syndrome	23246288		MUTATION
PIK3CA	E218K	ACTIVATING	A germline mutation found in patients with Cowden syndrome that lack a PTEN germline mutation.  This mutation results in increased p110? protein levels, elevated phospho-Thr308-AKT1 levels, and increased PIP3 levels		Cowden syndrome	23246288		MUTATION
PIK3CA	N345K	ACTIVATING	An infrequent somatic alteration that increases the positive charge of the protein and conveys strong oncogenic potential (Gymnopoulos et. al., 2007). The residue is located at the interface of the inner-SH2 and C2 domains, causing a disruption of this interaction when mutated (Burke et. al., 2012). This alteration results in increased lipid binding and lipid kinase activity and favors open/active conformation of the protein, leading to overall increased PI3K activity.			17376864, 22949682		MUTATION
PIK3CA	V356I	ACTIVATING	A germline mutation found in patients with Cowden syndrome that lack a PTEN germline mutation.  This mutation results in increased p110? protein levels and elevated phospho-Thr308-AKT1 levels (Orloff et al., 2012).		Cowden syndrome	23246288		MUTATION

PIK3CA	R382K	ACTIVATING	A germline mutation found in patients with Cowden syndrome that lack a PTEN germline mutation.  This mutation results in increased p110? protein levels, elevated phospho-Thr308-AKT1 levels, and increased PIP3 levels (Orloff et al., 2012).			23246288		MUTATION
PIK3CA	C420R	ACTIVATING	An infrequent somatic alteration that contains strong oncogenic potential (Gymnopoulos et. al., 2007). The residue is located at the interface of the inner-SH2 and C2 domains, and the mutation causes a disruption of this interaction (Burke et. al., 2012). It also increases lipid binding and lipid kinase activity and favors an open/active conformation of the protein, all leading to overall increased PI3K activity. Phosphopeptide binding competes with the auto-inhibitory activity of 110?, resulting in increased PI3K activity. Activity of this mutant is further enhanced by receptor tyrosine kinase phosphopeptide-binding that markedly exceeds wild-type activity (Hon et. al., 2012). 			17376864, 22949682, 22120714		MUTATION
PIK3CA	P539R	ACTIVATING	An infrequent somatic alteration that conveys strong oncogenic potential (Gymnopoulos et. al., 2007).			17376864		MUTATION

The mutation is in the kinase domain of PI3K. The mutant protein has a higher affinity for lipids, increased lipid kinase activity, and phosphorylation activity (Burke et. al., 2012; Hon et. al., 2012; Carson et. al., 2008).			17376864, 22949682, 18829572, 22120714, 17877460		MUTATION
PIK3CA	H1047L	ACTIVATING	A recurring somatic alteration found in multiple tumor types causing strong oncogenic potential (Gymnopoulos et. al., 2007).

Activity of this mutant is further enhanced by receptor tyrosine kinase phosphopeptide-binding that markedly exceeds wild-type activity (Hon et. al., 2012). The H1047L mutation was also acquired in a patient with KIT-positive gastrointestinal stromal tumor and was suggested to contribute to tumor progression (Daniels et. al., 2011). 			17376864, 22120714, 21906875		MUTATION
